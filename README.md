The income ranges of average monthly income has increased through years. Comparing from 2002/23 survey to 2017/18 survey the income ranges have escalated.
It is observed that higher household number has more monthly income but not in every case.
The graph is not very exponential with HDB flats compared to private properties 
Concentrating on private properties there are fluctuations in both as the household number increases
Filtering the graph with household size data, we can see the comparison in monthly income with the households size and dwelling unit type
The difference in monthly income in household size in HDB is not significant whereas it is more diverse in private properties like 5 and 6 or more in condominiums, 3 and 4 household in landed properties.
This gives the idea to explore the household earning peopleâ€™s ratio across the types of properties
Back to dwelling unit type, as moving to private properties is considered as a status symbol in Singapore, this data shows the differential increase over the years
Also the gap between both HDB and private is more exponential with higher household number
This can have more data on household earning persons, show the difference and can takeaway more insights.
Have added some filters to swap x and y axis as optional to get different graphs.
