1. The income ranges of average monthly income has increased through years. Comparing from 2002/23 survey to 2017/18 survey the income ranges have escalated.
2. It is observed that a higher household number has more monthly income, but not in every case.
3. The graph is not very exponential with HDB flats compared to private properties
4. Concentrating on private properties, there are fluctuations in both as the household number increases
5. Filtering the graph with household size data, we can see the comparison in monthly income with the households size and dwelling unit type
6. The difference in monthly income in household size in HDB is not significant whereas it is more diverse in private properties like 5 and 6 or more in condominiums, 3 and 4 households in landed properties.
7. This gives the idea to explore the household earning peopleâ€™s ratio across the types of properties
8. Back to dwelling unit type, as moving to private properties is considered a status symbol in Singapore, this data shows the differential increase over the years
9. Also the gap between both HDB and private is more exponential with a higher household number
10. This can have more data on household earning persons, show the difference and can take away more insights.
11. I have added some filters to swap the x and y axes as option to get different graphs.
